# TranslateMe

### This is a project I started to try to get more familiar with AWS tools and try to link backend with frontend along with create a database using AWS. I'm still learning much of the process and will be editing this as much as I can while in school.

## Main Idea

### Translate me is a java application using AWS translate to translate text into different languages. While the idea is simple, I plan on building it out to incorporate multiple features and eventually using REST API's / Spring to connect to a web server and be able to create a simple HTML/CSS interface to interact with it.

## AWS

### As of right now, AWS relies on my AWS free credentials account, and currently translates from any language.

### My idea was inspired by seeing different posts on reddit for people translating names or certain phrases multiple times from english to different languages and back. Currently, my application allows for this through the terminal and randomizes the different languages.
